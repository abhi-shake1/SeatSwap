## How It Works

### 1. User Registration
- Passengers create accounts with username, email, phone number
- Optional UPI ID for receiving payments
- Secure authentication system

### 2. Seat Listing Process
- User enters their PNR number
- System fetches journey details automatically
- User specifies seat details (type, number, coach)
- Sets exchange price and description
- Seat becomes available for booking

### 3. Seat Discovery & Booking
- Users browse available seats filtered by route
- Route matching ensures same source/destination
- Users can view detailed seat information
- Booking requires buyer's PNR verification

### 4. Payment Process
- UPI-based payment between users
- Buyer pays seller directly using UPI ID
- Transaction ID confirmation system
- Status tracking for exchanges

### 5. Admin Monitoring
- Ticket checkers can view all exchanges
- Track payment status and completion
- User and listing management

## API Integration

The application is designed to integrate with:
- **PNR Status API**: For fetching journey details
- **Station Code API**: For station name/code conversion

*Note: Current implementation uses mock data. Replace with actual API endpoints in production.*
