# PNR-Based Login and Seat Filtering Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a PNR-based login system where users must enter their current journey PNR after authentication, and the browse seats section now shows only relevant seats from their source to destination.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. PNR-Based Login Flow
- **Two-step login process**: Username/password â†’ PNR verification
- **Automatic journey details extraction**: System fetches train details, route, date, class from PNR
- **User profile updates**: Stores journey information for filtering

### 2. Enhanced User Profile Model
Added new fields to `UserProfile`:
- `current_pnr`: User's current journey PNR
- `source_station` & `source_station_code`: Journey source
- `destination_station` & `destination_station_code`: Journey destination  
- `journey_date`: Date of travel
- `travel_class`: Class of travel (3A, SL, etc.)
- `pnr_updated_at`: Timestamp of last PNR update

### 3. Passenger Details Display
- **New PassengerDetails model**: Stores individual passenger seat information
- **Seat details extraction**: Coach number, berth number, berth type (LB, MB, UB, etc.)
- **Enhanced UI**: Table display of all passengers with their seat assignments

### 4. Smart Seat Filtering
- **Route-based filtering**: Shows only seats matching user's journey route
- **Automatic filtering**: No manual input required - uses stored journey details
- **Additional search options**: Users can further refine results

## Testing

Created test scripts:
